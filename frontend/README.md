```bash
npm run dev

## Key Technologies
- **React** for building the user interface.

- **React Virtuoso** for list virtualization and smooth scrolling.


## Authentication Flow
The frontend seamlessly integrates with the backend's **iron-session** package and RainbowKitAuthenticationProvider on the frontend:
- On successful login, a session token is stored securely on the session backend and transferred to frontend via `httpOnly` cookie.
- Persistent session management is handled via encrypted cookies.
- Session cookie are used for authenticating subsequent API calls, ensuring a user-friendly and secure experience.
